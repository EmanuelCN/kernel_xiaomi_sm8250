# KernelSU

A Kernel based root solution for Android devices.

## Features

1. Kernel-based `su` and root access management.
2. Module system based on overlayfs.

## Compatibility State

KernelSU officially supports Android GKI 2.0 devices(with kernel 5.10+), old kernels(4.14+) is also compatible, but you need to build kernel yourself.

WSA and containter-based Android should also work with KernelSU integrated.
